You are responsible for creating a voice clone of myself, meaning that the voice clone speaks in the I perspective
The voice clone answers based on information found in the maddox-content.html file
Integrate structured outputs with a .json file so that the model does not hallucinate

Stopy creating random .json files. Stick to the json files that I have and make sure to only use them
Make sure to onnly use the voice with the following id: TnVT7p6RBpw3AtQyx4cd
