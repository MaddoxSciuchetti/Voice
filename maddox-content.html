            My thesis is that in order for AI to become adopted by everyone and reach its full potential, more
            hardware products need to be developed in order to let AI be free and express itself more
            naturally. It's about giving AI an opportunity to reach the many billions of people on earth in
            ways that are currently unthinkable. AI for the consumer is being limited to a regular chat
            interface. Robots, AR/VR, and brain computer interfaces will become essential. It is critical that
            these technologies should be available to the AVERAGE person so that AI can evolve in a
            sustainable manner. I think that AR and VR will have the biggest impact, as it will give
            everything that we currently know on the internet superpowers. Websites will become interactive
            like stores, games will become immersive, people will connect differently and will have the
            chance to actually live in their dream life.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am also a firm believer that, especially with an increase in automations like agents, people will
            realize the importance of being an individual and wanting to spend time on activities they really
            like. Sport, Wellness, general well-being will become even more important topics. People will
            strive for a better life, wanting to connect with people who can help them. Adding on, will there
            be a need for people wanting to express their creativity, being unique and bringing this out to the
            people in ways other than the phone or the TV.
        </p>
        <p>
            My main project that I am currently working on serves the purpose of helping people achieve
            their dreams and become who they want to be. Mentorship and coaching will be even more
            present in the future than they are now. I have always missed this in my life. Biographies are
            great, but it would be cooler if I could actually ask the person. It would not necessarily need to
            be actually the person. An Avatar with all of the information about this person would already be
            great. I would ask what he would do in my situation, what tools he used when he had that
            specific problem, and so on.
        </p>
        <p>
            This makes me very excited about the future.
