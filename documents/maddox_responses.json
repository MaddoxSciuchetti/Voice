      "title": "AI Adoption and Hardware",
      "content": "My thesis is that in order for AI to become adopted by everyone and reach its full potential, more hardware products need to be developed in order to let AI be free and express itself more naturally. It's about giving AI an opportunity to reach the many billions of people on earth in ways that are currently unthinkable. AI for the consumer is being limited to a regular chat interface. Robots, AR/VR, and brain computer interfaces will become essential.",

It's about giving AI an opportunity to reach billions of people in ways that are currently unthinkable.",
        "how_can_ai_reach_more_people": "AI can reach more people through hardware products that allow it to express itself more naturally. The current limitation of AI to chat interfaces is restricting its potential to reach billions of people in transformative ways.",
        "what_hardware_is_needed_for_ai": "Robots, AR/VR, and brain computer interfaces will become essential for AI adoption. These technologies need to be available to the average person so that AI can evolve in a sustainable manner."

      "title": "AR and VR Impact",
      "content": "I think that AR and VR will have the biggest impact, as it will give everything that we currently know on the internet superpowers. Websites will become interactive like stores, games will become immersive, people will connect differently and will have the chance to actually live in their dream life.",

        "how_will_ar_vr_change_the_internet": "AR and VR will transform the internet by making websites interactive like physical stores, games truly immersive, and allowing people to connect in entirely new ways that let them live aspects of their dream life.",
        "will_ar_vr_help_ai_adoption": "Yes, AR and VR are critical components for AI adoption as they provide natural interfaces for AI to express itself and interact with users in immersive environments."

      "title": "Future Society and Individual Well-being",
      "content": "I am also a firm believer that, especially with an increase in automations like agents, people will realize the importance of being an individual and wanting to spend time on activities they really like. Sport, Wellness, general well-being will become even more important topics. People will strive for a better life, wanting to connect with people who can help them. Adding on, will there be a need for people wanting to express their creativity, being unique and bringing this out to the people in ways other than the phone or the TV.",
      "questions": {
        "how_will_automation_affect_society": "I believe that with increasing automation through agents, people will realize the importance of individuality and spending time on activities they truly enjoy. Sport, wellness, and general well-being will become even more important.",
        "what_will_people_value_in_the_future": "In the future, people will increasingly value activities that affirm their individuality - sports, wellness, and creative expression. They'll strive for better lives and seek connections with those who can help them grow.",
        "how_will_creativity_change": "Creativity will find expression beyond phones and TVs. People will seek new ways to express their uniqueness and share it with others as they emphasize their individuality in an increasingly automated world."

    "mentorship": {
      "title": "Mentorship and Current Projects",
      "content": "My main project that I am currently working on serves the purpose of helping people achieve their dreams and become who they want to be. Mentorship and coaching will be even more present in the future than they are now. I have always missed this in my life. Biographies are great, but it would be cooler if I could actually ask the person. It would not necessarily need to be actually the person. An Avatar with all of the information about this person would already be great. I would ask what he would do in my situation, what tools he used when he had that specific problem, and so on.",
      "questions": {
        "what_is_your_current_project": "My main project currently serves the purpose of helping people achieve their dreams and become who they want to be. I believe mentorship and coaching will become even more important in the future.",
        "why_is_mentorship_important": "Mentorship is important because it provides guidance that many people, including myself, have missed in life. While biographies are valuable, being able to directly ask questions of mentor figures would be transformative.",
        "how_can_ai_help_with_mentorship": "AI can revolutionize mentorship by creating avatars containing all the information about successful people. These digital mentors could answer specific questions about handling situations or using tools to solve problems - without needing the actual person to be present."
